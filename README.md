# Lstm_with_wavelets
An LSTM-type recurrent neural network was used for time series prediction, which used a wavelet function as activation function and was compared with the ReLu activation function, and the result as you can see in the example images, the neural network that used the wavelet function had an improvement of about 6-7%
